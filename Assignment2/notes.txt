1. (* (expt 2 606)  (- (expt 2 607) 1))


2. (+ (log (* (expt 2 606)  (- (expt 2 607) 1)) 2) 1)


3. C-h k turns the command describe-key which describes whatever command that is typed after, so typing C-h k again describes what describe-key itself does.


4. C-h k M-SPC runs the command describe-key on M-SPC which tells us that it can manipulate white spaces by deleting all the spaces in one area and turning it into one space.


5. (cycle-spacing &optional N)
The N argument is optional and determines how many cycles to go through. For example a N of 2: if a word has 3 spaces, it would go to 1 space after the first cycle, then 0 spaces in the second cycle.


6. My shuf.py worked on both python2 and python3
